      <h4>Roark-Sullivan</h4>
      <p>In the winter of 1981, a group of concerned Charleston citizens decided to open a shelter for the
        homeless population of the Kanawha Valley. This movement was started due to the fact that many individuals
        living outside were freezing to death. These citizens used any building they could find that would keep
        people warm and dry; for example the Holley Hotel and the old Kanawha Valley Hospital building. Finally
        in 1983, the Charleston Men’s Emergency Shelter moved into a fire station on Florida Street and sought
        to help any man in need of shelter. From this, they eventually grew and expanded the type of services needed
        by the men seeking services. Visit them at <a href="http://www.rslwc.org">rslwc.org</a></p>
